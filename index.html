              ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS is a fellowship of people who share their
              experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve
              their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism.
              The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are no dues or fees for A.A. membership; we are
              self-supporting through our own contributions. A.A. is not allied
              with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or
              institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy; neither
              endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to stay
              sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.
