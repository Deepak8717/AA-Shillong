              ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS is a fellowship of people who share their
              experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve
              their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism.
              The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are no dues or fees for A.A. membership; we are
              self-supporting through our own contributions. A.A. is not allied
              with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or
              institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy; neither
              endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to stay
              sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.

          </div>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our
              path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not
              completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and
              women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with
              themselves. There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault;
              they seem to have been born that way. They are naturally incapable
              of grasping and developing a manner of living which demands
              rigorous honesty. Their chances are less than average. There are
              those, too, who suffer from grave emotional and mental disorders,
              but many of them do recover if they have the capacity to be
              honest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our stories disclose in a general way what we used to be like,
              what happened, and what we are like now. If you have decided you
              want what we have and are willing to go to any length to get
              it-then you are ready to take certain steps.
            </p>
            <p>
              At some of these we balked. We thought we could find an easier,
              softer way. But we could not. With all the earnestness at our
              command, we beg of you to be fearless and thorough from the very
              start. Some of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas and the
              result was nil until we let go absolutely.
            </p>
            <p>
              Remember that we deal with alcohol - cunning, baffling, powerful!
              Without help it is too much for us. But there is One who has all
              power-that One is God. May you find Him now!
            </p>
            <p>
              Half measures availed us nothing. We stood at the turning point.
              We asked His protection and care with complete abandon.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here are the steps we took, which are suggested as a program of
              recovery:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had
                become unmanageable.
              </li>
              <li>
                Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could
                restore us to sanity.
              </li>
              <li>
                Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care
                of God as we understood Him.
              </li>
              <li>
                Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.
              </li>
              <li>
                Admitted to God, to ourselves and to another human being the
                exact nature of our wrongs.
              </li>
              <li>
                Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of
                character.
              </li>
              <li>Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.</li>
              <li>
                Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to
                make amends to them all.
              </li>
              <li>
                Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when
                to do so would injure them or others.
              </li>
              <li>
                Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong
                promptly admitted it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious
                contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for
                knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.
              </li>
              <li>
                Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps,
                we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice
                these principles in all our affairs.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Many of us exclaimed, "What an order! I can't go through with it."
              Do not be discouraged. No one among us has been able to maintain
              anything like perfect adherence to these principles. We are not
              saints. The point is, that we are willing to grow along spiritual
              lines. The principles we have set down are guides to progress. We
              claim spiritual progress rather than spiritual perfection.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our description of the alcoholic, the chapter to the agnostic, and
              our personal adventures before and after make clear three
              pertinent ideas:
            </p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
              <li>
                That we were alcoholic and could not manage our own lives.
              </li>
              <li>
                That probably no human power could have relieved our alcoholism.
              </li>
              <li>That God could and would if He were sought.</li>
            </ol>

            <div><h3>AA Twelve Traditions</h3></div>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            <ol>
              <li>
                Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends
                upon A.A. unity.
              </li>
              <li>
                For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority - a
                loving God as He may express Himself in our group conscience.
                Our leaders are but trusted servants; they do not govern.
              </li>
              <li>
                The only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to stop
                drinking.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting
                other groups or A.A. as a whole.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each group has but one primary purpose - to carry its message to
                the alcoholic who still suffers.
              </li>
              <li>
                An A.A. group ought never endorse, finance or lend the A.A. name
                to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of
                money, property and prestige divert us from our primary purpose.
              </li>
              <li>
                Every A.A. group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining
                outside contributions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Alcoholics Anonymous should remain forever nonprofessional, but
                our service centers may employ special workers.
              </li>
              <li>
                A.A., as such, ought never be organized; but we may create
                service boards or committees directly responsible to those they
                serve.
              </li>
              <li>
                Alcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the
                A.A. name ought never be drawn into public controversy.
              </li>
              <li>
                Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than
                promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the
                level of press, radio and films.
              </li>
              <li>
                Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions,
                ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.

            <p>
              Our book is meant to be suggestive only. We realize we know only a
              little. God will constantly disclose more to you and to us.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ask Him in your morning meditation what you can do each day for
              the man who is still sick. The answers will come, if your own
              house is in order.
            </p>
            <p>
              But obviously you cannot transmit something you haven't got. See
              to it that your relationship with Him is right, and great events
              will come to pass for you and countless others. This is the Great
              Fact for us.
            </p>
            <p>
              Abandon yourself to God as you understand God. Admit your faults
              to Him and to your fellows. Clear away the wreckage of your past.
              Give freely of what you find and join us.
            </p>
            <p>
              We shall be with you in the Fellowship of the Spirit, and you will
              surely meet some of us as you trudge the Road of Happy Destiny.
            </p>
            <p>May God bless you and keep you -- until then.</p>
